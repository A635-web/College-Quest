College Club Application System
Overview
The College Club Application System is a web application designed to streamline the process of applying to college clubs. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), it enables students to easily apply to clubs and allows coordinators to manage applications efficiently.

Features
User Authentication: Secure signup and login using JWT.
Student Dashboard: View available clubs and submit applications.
Coordinator Dashboard: Manage club applications with options to accept or reject.
Concurrency Handling: Pessimistic locking mechanism to ensure data integrity during concurrent operations.
Scalable Design: Optimized to handle the data of 4000+ students.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Responsive UI for students and coordinators.
State management with React Hooks.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
RESTful APIs for handling data flow.
JWT-based authentication for secure access.
Database: MongoDB
Flexible schema design to store users, clubs, and applications.
Pessimistic locking to manage concurrent operations.
Others:
Axios for API requests.
Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/college-club-application-system.git
cd college-club-application-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

plaintext
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
# Run backend
npm run server

# Run frontend
cd client
npm start
Access the application:

Visit http://localhost:3000 for the frontend.
Backend runs on http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Student Workflow
Sign up and log in.
View available clubs on the dashboard.
Apply to clubs by filling out the application form.
Track the status of your applications.
Coordinator Workflow
Log in with coordinator credentials.
View all applications submitted to your club.
Accept or reject applications.
Manage club information.
Database Schema
Users Collection:

name: String
email: String
password: String (hashed)
role: String ("student" or "coordinator")
Clubs Collection:

name: String
coordinatorId: ObjectId (Reference to Users)
description: String
Applications Collection:

studentId: ObjectId (Reference to Users)
clubId: ObjectId (Reference to Clubs)
status: String ("pending", "accepted", "rejected")
locked: Boolean
lockedBy: ObjectId (Reference to Users)
lockedAt: Date
Pessimistic Locking Implementation
To ensure data integrity during concurrent operations, a pessimistic locking mechanism is used. This is achieved by adding a locked field in the Applications collection to prevent multiple coordinators from modifying the same application simultaneously.

Challenges Faced
Scalability: Ensured that the system can handle data for 4000+ students.
Concurrency Management: Implemented a custom locking mechanism to manage concurrent operations without conflicts.
Authentication Security: Used JWT for secure user sessions and API protection.
Future Prospects
Notification System: Implement email or in-app notifications for application status updates.
Enhanced Concurrency Handling: Explore more advanced concurrency controls, such as distributed locks.
Mobile App Development: Extend the platform to mobile devices for broader accessibility.
